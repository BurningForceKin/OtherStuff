# OtherStuff
This is here I keep my Art&amp;Design projects. Feel free to download and make these projects yourself. (for personal use, obviously)

# Matter test

A small sketch for me to test the Matter.js engine. Download the files and run index.html on your browser :)

# Midi Verhuizing

The second sketch I made with Matter.js. This one also uses the Midi.js sketch to enable musical keyboard control.
Connect your USB-MIDI keyboard/drumpad to your computer. The sketch listens to input 1. Playing some notes within a certain range makes a bunch of boxes fall.


# Phage

Here you can download the files to make your own Phage. The head should be printed on thick A4 paper. Glue the 3D-prints together with superglue or hotglue.
The bottom of the Phage can hold a cheap [8 ohm speaker](https://hackerstore.nl/Artikel/15). Make sure to solder two wires onto it that will connect to the head.
Inside the head is a Adafruit FX Soundboard and a [small 5V amplifier circuit](https://hackerstore.nl/Artikel/431).
