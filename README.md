This is here I keep my Art&amp;Design projects. Feel free to download and make these projects yourself. (for personal use, obviously)

# Phage

Here you can download the files to make your own Phage. The head should be printed on thick A4 paper. Glue the 3D-prints together with superglue or hotglue.
The bottom of the Phage can hold a cheap [8 ohm speaker](https://hackerstore.nl/Artikel/15). Make sure to solder two wires onto it that will connect to the head.
Inside the head is a Adafruit FX Soundboard and a [small 5V amplifier circuit](https://hackerstore.nl/Artikel/431).
